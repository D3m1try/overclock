This programm changes PLL registers over i2c/SMbus, and FSB clock speed changes too. :)

If your PLL is not supported you can do following:

1. Download datasheet, read it, add write support by yourself.
   Test it. Send code and results to me.
   That is the easy way. :)

2. Send email to me with name of your PLL and when possible with URL pointing to datasheet for it.
   Wait some time.
   Download new version with support for your PLL.
   Test it. Send results to me.
   That is the hard way. :)

3. Go to Bobrooysk and drink poison.

To check PLL i2c/SMbus availability run:
i2cdetect X
i2cdump X 0x69 s (read manual, block read/write is not always possible)
X is the number of your bus.

And yes, this programm can damage your hardware.

Also make sure not to use the tsc time source when using this program as this time source is included in the CPU and run at wrong speed after changing FSB. You can accompish this by adding a boot parameter to the command line from your boot manager "clocksource=acpi_pm" or from command line with:
echo acpi_pm >/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource.
