This programm changes PLL registers over i2c/SMbus, and FSB clock speed changes too. :)

If your PLL is not supported you can do following:

1. Download datasheet, read it, add write support by yourself.
   Test it. Send code and results to me.
   That is the easy way. :)

2. Send email to me with name of your PLL and when possiple with URL pointing to datasheet for it.
   Wait some time.
   Download new version with support for your PLL.
   Test it. Send results to me.
   That is the hard way. :)

3. Go to Bobrooysk and drink poison.

To check PLL i2c/SMbus availability run:
i2cdetect X
i2cdump X 0x69 s (read manual, block read/write is not always possible)
X is the number of your bus.

And yes, this programm can damage your hardware.
